# linear-regression-lab-assignment
machine learning assignment on linear regression

problem definition:</br>
You are expected to generate a fake Nairobi Office Price Simulated dataset of size 100 with one</br>
feature 𝒙 (office size assume a suitable distribution) and one target 𝑦 (office price also assume a</br>
suitable distribution).</br>
Write class logic for Mean Squared Error to be used as your Performance Measure Technique</br>
and Gradient Descent as your learning algorithm</br>
Set random initial values for slope (m) and y-intercept (c) and train an intelligent linear regression</br>
model of your dataset above then plot the line of best fit</br>
Use the above learnt line to predict the office price when the size is 100 sq. ft.</br>
